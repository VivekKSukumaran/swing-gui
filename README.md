# swing-gui
This is a JAVA project for Database connectivity with Java Swing UI and the database is associated with MySQL. 
The project is an Online Membership System for New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) which allows people associated with NJIT to sign up to be members of the system.
Every user who signs up must have an NJIT ID which is used as an identification. Every new user needs to fill in their name, email address, state and phone number for registration. The user needs to create a password and then confirm the password for their account. The email id and the password are authentication for the members to access their account.

Usage Instructions: 
For users:
•	Every new user who visits the online membership system is provided with an option for new user sign up.
•	The new user needs to sign up by entering his/her name, email id, NJIT id, state where they live and phone number.
•	The user needs to create a password which is later used as an authentication for the user to access the membership system.
•	Upon successful registration the user can see a display message which confirms the user registration has been successful.
•	After registration, user can login using their email id and the password and the user sees a welcome message saying they have logged in successfully.

For admin:
•	Admin can login to their account using their admin email id and admin password which in this case we have set up as “admin” for both.
• Once the admin has successfully logged in the admin has access to add records, edit records and delete records.
